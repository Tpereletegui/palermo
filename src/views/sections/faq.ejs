      <div class="label">What is a Private Lender?</div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>A Private Lender is an investor who makes loans secured by real estate, typically charging higher rates than banks but
          also making loans that banks would not make, funding more quickly than banks and/or requiring less documentation than
          banks.</p>

      <div class="label">Why do Private Lenders exist?</div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Private Lenders exist because many real estate investors need a quick response / funding to secure a deal when looking
          for a real estate loan. Banks and other institutional lenders that offer the lowest interest rates donâ€™t provide the same
          combination of speed and transparency in their decision-making process, along with quick access to capital.</p>

      <div class="label">When should one use a Private Lender?</div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>A borrower might consider using a private money / private money loan in situations where he or she is willing to pay a
          higher interest rate and/or higher up-front fees in the interest of gaining access to capital more quickly, dealing with less
          bureaucracy and more transparency during the application process, and finding capital to pursue an opportunity that
          banks will not finance, either because they are unwilling or unable to do so.</p>
